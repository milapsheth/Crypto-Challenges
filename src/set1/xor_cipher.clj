;; Challenge 3

;; Single-byte XOR cipher
;; The hex encoded string:

;; 1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736
;; ... has been XOR'd against a single character. Find the key, decrypt the message.

;; You can do this by hand. But do not: write code to do it for you.

;; How? Devise some method for "scoring" a piece of English plaintext. Character frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the best score.


;; English letters in decreasing order of frequency
